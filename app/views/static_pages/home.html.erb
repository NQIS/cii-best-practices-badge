  <h2 class>CII Best Practices Badge Program</h2>
   <p>
    The Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)
    Best Practices badge is a way for Free/Libre and
    Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects to
    show that they follow best practices. Projects can voluntarily self-certify,
    at no cost, by using this web application to explain how they follow each
    best practice. The CII Best Practices Badge is inspired by the many badges
    available to projects on GitHub. Consumers of the badge will be able to
    quickly assess which FLOSS projects are following best practices and as a
    result are more likely to produce higher-quality secure software.
